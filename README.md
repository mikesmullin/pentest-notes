# My Pentest Cheatsheets

**Â§ßÂÆ∂Â•ΩÔºÅüëã**

I found this note taking strategy the best: 
- I use `vscode` with Markdown `*.md` file format,
- with a directory structure grouping notes under `cmds/<os>/`, `practices/`, `protocols/`, and `tools/{apt,github,web}/`,
- where each line of each file is using a prefix of one of:
  - `# ` the beginning of a comment line, which contains Markdown format
  - `$ ` the beginning of a Linux/MacOS bash prompt command
  - `C:\> ` the beginning of a Windows cmd.exe prompt command  
  and a few other specialty shells like:
  - `PS> ` powershell
  - `msf> ` Metasploit `msfconsole`
  - etc.

This convention makes note-taking very clear and reusable. I frequently utilize the `Ctrl-P` hotkey to quickly jump to a topic by file, or `Ctrl-Shift-F` to search for a note by keyword.

Additionally, during a pentesting engagement, I will create a directory structure like `net/<IP>.md` with one file per host, where I keep additional notes regarding the history of my input/output interactions with each machine on the network.

This repo is mainly for me to refer back to, but I'm sharing publicly just in case anyone else finds these helpful! 

P.S. Rather than browsing online in the Github viewer, just clone and open in vscode. Or else toggle the `?plain=1` view always. Otherwise the format will appear difficult to read.

There are many many similar works and each has their own merit. It would be a waste to reproduce them here. Instead, I'll link to my favorites.
