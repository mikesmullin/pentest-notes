# wow, nc can be used like an nmap CONNECT scan (3-way tcp handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)

nc -nvv -w 1 -z 142.250.72.78 80-82

# `-n` numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
# `-vv` verbose output, to see connect/reject outcomes
# `-w 1` wait 1 sec before aborting per-host
# `-z` zero-I/o mode [used for scanning] (even says so in the `-h` help!)
# `142.250.72.78` host to scan
# `80-82` port range to scan


# udp scan
nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.11.1.115 160-162
# `-u` udp proto

# When the destination UDP port is closed, the convention is 
# for the target is e respond with an "ICMP port unreachable" message.
# However, in a secure network, these messages are filtered,
# therefore the default is for nc to assume the tx was successful (open)



# listening to a bound interface
nc -lvp 6666 -s 192.168.119.198




# different implementations of the same idea

# `nc` and `netcat` are two names for the same program (typically, one is a symlink to the other)
# additinoally, there are two flavors of this binary: 
# `traditional` written by Hobbit, the most common version which includes `-e`
# `OpenBSD` supposedly an improvement to support Unix, ipv6, but removes `-e` option
# similarly, we have a separate attempt to improve upon the idea, this time by Nmap team
# `ncat` is the version which supports `--broker`


# Transfer a file through an intermediary (like a chat broadcaster)

host3$ ncat -l --broker
host2$ ncat host3 > outputfile
host1$ ncat --send-only host3 < inputfile

# NOTICE: the brokering can be done by `socat`, alternatively
# NOTICE: the endpoints can be `nc` or other, as well (so ncat not needed really)

# NOTICE: `ncat` also supports `--ssl` option for manual enum of ssl endpoints
