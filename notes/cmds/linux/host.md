host megacorpone.com

# By default, the host command looks for an A record, but we can also query other fields, such as MX or TXT records. To do this, we can use the -t option to specify the type of record we are looking for

host -t mx megacorpone.com

# types of records:
#   NS - Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
#   A - Also known as a host record, the “a record” contains the IP address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
#   MX - Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
#   PTR - Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and are used to find the records associated with an IP address.
#   CNAME - Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
#   TXT - Text records can contain any arbitrary data and can be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.
