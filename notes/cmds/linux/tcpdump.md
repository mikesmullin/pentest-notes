sudo tcpdump -n -N -A -s 2048 -i lo 'tcp port 6665'

# `-n` don't reverse port numbers to names
# `-N` don't reverse-lookup ip to dns names
# `-A` print intercepted data as ASCII (ignoring binary; terminal-safe)
# `-s 2048` configure truncation at 2048 bytes (default is low)
# `-i lo` interface (ie. loopback)
# `tcp port 6665` libpcap filter syntax



# `-r a.pcap` can also be used to read from .pcap files
