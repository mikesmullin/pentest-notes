# Privilege Escalation (general)
# at each stage, looking for;
# elevation of privilege (EoP):
# - av (to avoid)
# - user>groups, svcs/processes/drivers>versions>exploits,
# - writable configs, suid binaries, misconfigurations
# looting:
# - secrets in plaintext on disk
# pivoting:
# - net interfaces, subnets, mounts, established conns, listening ports

# if we can write to /etc/shadow we can replace root user pw hash with one we know
mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpassword
# alternatively we can even append to the file, because linux allows multiple usernames to share a UID
# if we can write to /etc/password, we can just turn off the password
# also look for readable backups of interesting files in /var/backups /tmp /etc /

# look for any * wildcard expansions
# see: https://materials.rangeforce.com/tutorial/2019/11/08/Linux-PrivEsc-Wildcard/


# `LD_PRELOAD=` env var
# must have same real user id and effective user id
# when set, `.so` file is loaded beefore any others
# `init()` fn is executed immediately
# EXCEPTION: if using sudo, must env_keep the var
# EXCEPTION: ignored by suid binaries

# `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` env var
# changes which path libs are searched for first
# EXCEPTION: ignored by suid binaries
# we can list which libs will be loaded by a given binary this way
ldd /usr/sbin/apache2
# `strace` can also be used to identify attempts to load libs that are NOT FOUND (can run non-root)
strace some_bin 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"

# `crontab`
# if no abs path used in crontab, can place file in earlier path used by crontab

# `PATH=` env var
# can be modified to intercept relative paths
# `strings` and `strace` and `ltrace` can help find relative paths (ie. in SUID bins)

# `Bash < 4.2-048`
# can export functions that take precedence over binary in $PATH
/bin/sh --version
function /usr/sbin/service { /bin/bash -p; }
export -f /usr/bin/service
# now run suid that attempts to invoke that bin using abs path

# `Bash < 4.4`
# can use `SHELLOPTS=` and `-x` and `PS4=` env vars to execute a cmd (ie. if `system()` is used by the bin)
env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(whoami)' suid_binary


# `kernel exploits` the most common ones
# ie. kernel 2.6.39 <= 3.2.2 (mempodipper) is a nice one

Example:
## We found cp (copy) in the above list and now we are abusing it:
cp -f --no-preserve=all /etc/shadow /var/www/html/joomla/shadow.txt


Few things to keep in mind:
## (1) at the destination, the file owner will be root but the group will be that of the current user and 
## (2) notice the use of "--no-preserve" this is needed to read out protected files.
## A lot of ways we can abuse this, update the shadow file with a new account, modify sudoers, plant ssh key + modify sshd_config ## + reboot,or cron.hourly.
