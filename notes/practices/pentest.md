## Post-Exploitation Cleanup
# cleanup is generally regarded as removing anything malicious
# as to prevent unwitting users from stumbling/triggering bad side-effects.
# it doesn't exactly mean stealth, as in leaving no evidence behind.
# ie. it would be okay to leave a script behind that cleans up other malicious tools. you can think of it as re-entrant safe.
