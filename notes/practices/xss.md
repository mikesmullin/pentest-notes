# [nice guide](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/103)
# NOTE to self: could apply the Prevention chapter in my apps

# things you can do, if you can write html+js:
# - OOB exfil data (ie. document.cookie, session)
# - XHR requests against insecure endpoints
# - clickjacking
# - bitcoin mining
# - displaying ads
# - trick into a click escalating to code download + execution
# - browser buffer overflow + rce
# - browser plugin/extension exploit
# - display phishing forms (ie. session expired. please login)
# - spread to additional hosts which might be more vulnerable

# attack categories:
# - Stored (Persistent) XSS
#   user input stored and reflected by server until changed
#   ie. publishing malicious message
# - Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS
#   user input reflected by server once
#   ie. sharing malicious link to victim
# - DOM-based XSS
#   user input reflected client-side
#   ie. sharing malicious link to victim
