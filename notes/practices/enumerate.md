# Passive Information Gathering (ie. indirect/2nd-degree information gathering)
# OSINT (ie. osintframework)
# goal: obtain information that helps us:
#         a) clarify/expand attack surface, b) phish, c) guess creds
# - public search engines and "dorks" (Google Hacking Database)
# - cached public site analyzers
#   - whois, dns, arin, historical archives (Netcraft, Archive.org)
#   - nmap+vulns (Shodan)
#   - ssl (Qualys SSL Labs)
#   - http response headers (securityheaders.com)
# - social media (employees, emails, interests, wordlists)
#   - twitter (`twofi`)
#   - linkedin (`linkedin2username`)
#   - stackoverflow
# - repos (stack, secrets, employees)
#   - github, gitlab, sourceforge
# - pastebins (etc.)
# - stackoverflow (employees, stack)

# Active Information Gathering (ie. direct interaction)
# - happy path
# - enumerating/querying exposed directory/indexing services
#   warning: scanners can generate a lot of traffic; measure with a test subject
#   - Active Directory
#     - impacket Python scripts (ie. cli interaction w/ SMB1-3 and MSRPC protocols)
#       see: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/python-for-network-penetration-testing-hacking-windows-domain-controllers-with-impacket-python-tools/
#     - ldapclient
#     - smbclient
#     - bloodhound
#       see: https://hausec.com/2019/03/12/penetration-testing-active-directory-part-ii/
#   - DNS
#     - zone xfer (dnsrecon, nmap script)
#     - subdomains brute force (dig, sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh)
#   - TCP/UDP ports
#     - scan (nmap, massscan, nc)
#   - ARP, SNMP
#   - SMB + NetBIOS (nbtscan, nmap)
#   - NFS, SMTP
# - HTTP/Web Fingerprinting
#  - Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith

# Bulk Active Scanning (Nessus=>OpenVAS,  etc.)
# - update the signature database before every engagement, for the best chance of discovering the latest vulnerabilities.
# - fine to run automation first, but follow it up with manual testing to catch false positives and negatives
# - automation is not good if stealth is required. its more for engagements where time is artificially constrained.
# - may need to throttle to avoid overwhelming target services, or tripping IDPS blocks
