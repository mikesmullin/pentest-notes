# Twofi scans a userâ€™s Twitter feed and generates a personalized wordlist used for password attacks against that user. While we will not run any attacks during passive information gathering, we can run this tool against any Twitter accounts we have identified to have a wordlist ready when needed. Twofi requires a valid Twitter API key.
