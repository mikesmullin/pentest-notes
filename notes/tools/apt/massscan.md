# Masscan is arguably the fastest port scanner; it can scan the entire Internet in about 6 minutes. transmitting an astounding 10 million packets per second! While it was originally designed to scan the entire Internet, it can easily handle a class A or B subnet, which is a more suitable target range during a penetration test.

# Masscan is not installed on Kali by default; it must be installed using apt
sudo apt install masscan


# usage
sudo masscan -p80 10.11.1.0/24 --rate=1000 -e tap0 --router-ip 10.11.0.1
