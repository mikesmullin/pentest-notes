# Maltego is a very powerful data mining tool that offers an endless combination of search tools and strategies. The learning curve for it can be steep, and it is frankly overkill for this module, but its impressive capability warrants an introduction.

# Maltego searches thousands of online data sources, and uses extremely clever “transforms” to convert one piece of information into another. For example, if we are performing a user information gathering campaign, we could submit an email address, and through various automated searches, “transform” that into an associated phone number or street address. During an organizational information gathering exercise, we could submit a domain name and “transform” that into a web server, then a list of email addresses, then a list of associated social media accounts, and then into a potential password list for that email account.

# Maltego CE (the limited “community version” of Maltego) is included in Kali and requires a free registration to use. Commercial versions are also available and can handle larger datasets.

# Maltego is not required to complete any material in the labs, but it can be an indispensable tool for large information gathering operations.
