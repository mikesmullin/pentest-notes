# `searchsploit` is a cli binary to query exploit-db.com
# both are designed, operated, and maintained by Offensive-Security.com.
# so it is a tad self-promotional to teach this on their certification courses.
# Be aware there are other resources, as well.

# NOTICE: many online exploit Proof-of-Concept (PoC) scripts DO 
#         expect you to tweak them before they can be applied successfully.
